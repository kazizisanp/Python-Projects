# Python-Projects
It's all about projects.
I am new to coding. Every day I am trying to learn something new and doing some small projects to improve my coding skills. A thought came into my mind: why don't I share all those projects with others too? That's why this repository exists. It's nothing new. Everything is available on the internet. Still, I thought maybe someone out there like me could benefit from these projects.
